O(1) - immediate.

O(n) - linear time or space compelxity, not bad, gets bigger over time the more you put into it.

O(log n) - opposite of exponential, it's actually pretty great outcome. Not as good as O(n), but better than O(n^2)

O(n^2) - could be like a nested loop, not ideal


Logarithmic expressions.
Recap, what is logarithmic?
log2(8) = 3
meaning, 2^3 = 8

**Why know this?**

Certain searching algos have logarithmic time complexity

Efficient sorting algos involve logarithims

Recursion osmetimes involves logarithmic space complexity.
