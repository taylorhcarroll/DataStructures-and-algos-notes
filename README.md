# DataStructures-and-algos-notes

Hi This is a repository of my notes for the datastructure and algorithims udemy course. I may also add in my own notes and research as well. The point is I noticed if I want to take notes and make example code google docs is not going to work for my puposes (and if anybody is ever going to read or look back over it!)
